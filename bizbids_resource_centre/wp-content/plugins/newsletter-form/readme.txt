**Our Floating Tab and Quick Install Shortcodes**

The most popular implementation of the Newsletter Signup form plugin places a callout tab overlay onto the margins of your website so that it’s visible on every page. The callout Newsletter Signup form tab, using “Newsletter” as the default text (although there are options for additional text), opens up the hosted Newsletter Signup form created by this plugin. (More about our Newsletter Signup form callout tabs [here](http://www.contactus.com/callout-tabs/) ). Use this method if you’re using your Newsletter Signup form to proactively generate opt-in email submissions from your website because it’ll get your form seen by more of your website visitors. Users can select different Newsletter Signup forms and callout tab designs. Specifically for WordPress, WordPress Developers can also place a shortcodes on specific pages or posts to embed the Newsletter Signup form.

**More Advanced Placements:**

* **Inline:** Websites looking for basic Newsletter Signup forms to capture general website inquiries.
